# Virtual Coding Assistant for DiPY

Welcome to the Virtual Coding Assistant for DiPY repository! This assistant leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Python, Transformers, Vector Databases, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance coding productivity and efficiency within the DiPY (Diffusion Imaging in Python) codebase.

## Project Overview

The Virtual Coding Assistant is designed to help developers interactively write, debug, and understand code in the DiPY environment. Using a locally hosted LLM integrated with the LangGraph RAG pipeline, the assistant provides real-time coding insights and solutions.

### Features

- **Code Generation:** Automatically generate code snippets based on natural language prompts.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Utilize advanced prompt engineering techniques to interpret complex coding queries effectively.
- **Debugging Assistance:** Offer suggestions for debugging and optimizing code.
- **Documentation Aid:** Instantly fetch and display relevant portions of documentation within the coding environment.
